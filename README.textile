Towards a modular framework for interacting with external debuggers.

Debuggers we currently support are:

 * "bashdb":http://bashdb.sf.net  (BASH)
 * gdb  
 * "kshdb":https://github.com/rocky/kshdb/wiki (Korn Shell)
 * perldb (Perl)
 * "Devel::Trepan":https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan/wiki (Perl)
 * "pydb":http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/pydb/ (Python)
 * "pydbgr":http://code.google.com/p/pydbgr/ (Python)
 * "trepanning":https://github.com/rocky/rb-trepanning/wiki (Ruby 1.9)
 * "rb8-trepanning":https://github.com/rocky/rb8-trepanning/wiki (MRI Ruby 1.8 and an unpatched YARV 1.9)
 * "rbx-trepanning":https://github.com/rocky/rbx-trepanning/wiki (for Rubinius)
 * "remake":http://bashdb.sf.net/remake (GNU Make)
 * ruby-debug (Ruby)
 * "zshdb":https://github.com/rocky/zshdb/wiki (Zsh)

The debugger is run out of a comint process buffer, or you can use a "track-mode" inside an existing shell.

To install you'll need a couple of other Emacs packages installed. See "the installation instructions":http://wiki.github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/how-to-install for details.

To get started using see the "notes on using emacs-dbgr":http://wiki.github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/how-to-use .
